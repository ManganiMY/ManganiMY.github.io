    <p>A fantasy battle series at the heart of Jump Square, written by 
Yuji Kaku, who brings a unique perspective to the mix with his 
experience as a manga editor. Since becoming serialized, Jigokraku has 
come into the spotlight as one of the next big series to watch out for, 
with many readers anticipating a mixed media adaptation. It has over 1.3
 million physical copies in circulation so far. At the release of the 
fourth volume, a free entry exhibition of the original illustrations was
 held, which ended up being a huge success.

   <p class="interviewer">――So it was the previous editor who started up the series?</p>
   <div class="thumbnail"><img src="MANGA%20Plus%20Interviewing%20editors_bestanden/thumbnail-sakakibara.png"></div>
   <p><b>Sakakibara:</b> 
    Yes, that’s right, the plan for Jigokurau was created while the 
previous editor was in charge. About 2 years ago in 2017, the editors at
 Jump Plus were shown the storyboard for the first 3 chapters of a new 
series by Yuji Kaku, who had already been published in Jump Square. When
 asked who was interested in working on the series, I eagerly 
volunteered. When I read the name I was amazed, it looked so 
interesting! I was passionate about taking it on, and ended up editing 
chapters 2 and 3 for Jump Plus, and took them to the review meeting 
myself.</p>

   <p class="interviewer">――Was there competition between the editors? </p>
   <div class="thumbnail"><img src="MANGA%20Plus%20Interviewing%20editors_bestanden/thumbnail-sakakibara.png"></div>
   <p><b>Sakakibara:</b> 
    There was no competition like what you see in the pages of 
Jigokuraku (laughs). It’s not clear who the other candidates were, but I
 did hear a number of people were being considered. That’s why I 
directly voiced my desire to take on this project with the Chief Editor 
(laughs). </p>
   </div>

   
     
   <div class="comment">
   <p class="interviewer">――And where did that desire come from?</p>
   <div class="thumbnail"><img src="MANGA%20Plus%20Interviewing%20editors_bestanden/thumbnail-sakakibara.png"></div>
   <p><b>Sakakibara:</b> 
    First off, I love Kaku-sensei’s illustrations. I’ve been a fan of 
his drawings, especially those big impact panels, since seeing his 
series FANTASMA, which was published in Jump Square. In my opinion, 
they’re not only drawn well, but have the power and charm to attract 
readers. My personal feelings were also in the balance. At the time, it 
was my second or third year since becoming an editor, and I felt 
pressure to build up a series that would become popular with readers and
 be a big seller in print - I felt as if there was a wall before me, it 
was a very big goal.  Amongst all that, I knew that Jigokuraku would be 
the title to overcome that obstacle. Besides that, it had been four 
years since Jump Plus was founded. Amongst all the great manga that were
 made possible due to the digital medium, it was still missing a 
mainstream battle fantasy manga. A series like One-Punch Man, which was 
huge hit. There was a great a need for such a mainstream battle manga on
 Jump Plus as a whole. We all had the shared goal of making it the 
number one digital manga magazine, and creating a new hit on Jump Plus. 
Considering all this, I knew that Kaku-sensei’s title would be the one 
to live up to that and so I passionately appealed to take it on by 
saying “I would definitely like to take charge of this!” (laughs). </p>
   </div>


   <div class="txtarea-ttl">【Becoming Kaku-sensei’s Editor】</div>
   
   <div class="comment">
   <p class="interviewer">――What was your first impression of Kaku-sensei?</p>
   <div class="thumbnail"><img src="MANGA%20Plus%20Interviewing%20editors_bestanden/thumbnail-sakakibara.png"></div>
   <p><b>Sakakibara:</b> 
     I had originally seen them on television. It was FANTASMA’s section
 on Jump’s TV program. I had just stumbled across it and thought, “What a
 cool author!” - that was my very first impression. Meeting him in real 
life, he was actually really cool (laughs). </p>
   </div>
   
   <div class="comment">
   <p class="interviewer">――How did you pick up from the previous editor? </p>
   <div class="thumbnail"><img src="MANGA%20Plus%20Interviewing%20editors_bestanden/thumbnail-sakakibara.png"></div>
   <p><b>Sakakibara:</b> 
      The previous editor was a little crude. Even though it was the 
first time we had met, he just said, “Your editor has changed” to 
Kaku-sensei. Then he was just like “Well, good luck! See ya!” to me 
(laughs). </p>
   </div>
   
      <div class="comment">
   <p class="interviewer">――What did you talk about then?</p>
   <div class="thumbnail"><img src="MANGA%20Plus%20Interviewing%20editors_bestanden/thumbnail-sakakibara.png"></div>
   <p><b>Sakakibara:</b> 
     I asked Kaku-sensei about what he wanted to do with Jigokuraku, and
 what he wanted to express. At that point, the character designs had 
already been made, so he told me what he wanted to do with each of them,
 and how he wanted them to unfold. By the second chapter, a lot of the 
characters made an appearance and it’s really exciting, isn’t it? I 
remember looking at all their prototypes and being all like “So cool!” 
and “Awesome!!” (laughs). </p>
   </div>

   
         <figure><img src="MANGA%20Plus%20Interviewing%20editors_bestanden/vol6-item1.png" class="ph-border position-H" alt="ph"></figure>

   
   <div class="comment">
   <p class="interviewer">――Are there any characters that were changed?</p>
   <div class="thumbnail"><img src="MANGA%20Plus%20Interviewing%20editors_bestanden/thumbnail-sakakibara.png"></div>
   <p><b>Sakakibara:</b> 
    The number one favorite in our first character popularity poll, 
Shion. When I first heard about him from Kaku-sensei, I thought he was 
such a crazy character. I imagined him like Kazuo Kiriyama from Battle 
Royale. After talking it over, we decided to make him into the kind 
teacher he is today. That crazy personality he had the time was 
eventually taken up by Shugen instead (laughs).</p>
   </div>   

   
   <div class="comment">
   <p class="interviewer">――What else did you talk over with Kaku-sensei?</p>
   <div class="thumbnail"><img src="MANGA%20Plus%20Interviewing%20editors_bestanden/thumbnail-sakakibara.png"></div>
   <p><b>Sakakibara:</b> 
    I still remember Kaku-sensei wanted to make it like a buddy film, or
 a multi-protagonist story. I was worried about the latter. We already 
had all these elements like the prisoners, executioners, and the 
island’s strange creatures; while I thought it would be interesting to 
add that Battle Royale style story development, in manga, the actions of
 the main character are huge focal point. If we were to add that kind of
 multi-protagonist view, we’d have to split the pages up between 
characters, which would lead to a badly paced story, and we wouldn’t be 
able to show the main character in action as much – that was my biggest 
worry. However, it turns out that with Kaku-sensei’s genius, there was 
no need to fear (laughs). What I mean is that in Jigokuraku, the 
characters are drawn in quickly and simply. What in other works it would
 take pages or even chapters, Jigokuraku expresses in only a few panels 
or pages. Thanks to Kaku-sensei’s talent for drawing, we were able to 
make this multi-protagonist story with so many characters, while still 
maintaining good pacing (laughs). </p>
   </div>

   <p class="interviewer">――What do you keep in mind when making a title?</p>
   <div class="thumbnail"><img src="MANGA%20Plus%20Interviewing%20editors_bestanden/thumbnail-sakakibara.png"></div>
   <p><b>Sakakibara:</b> 
    The pacing, and seeing it all objectively from the perspective of 
being its very first reader. I take on that role with the draft, and I 
try to give a straight, honest opinion. Also, as Jump Plus isn’t 
anywhere near as well known as Jump itself, I need to keep working hard 
to spread the word that Jigokuraku exists and that it’s good. I mean, 
ceating a social media account and advertising on it is simple enough. 
But setting up an exhibition as we did at the launch of the fourth 
volume was very different from the everyday work of an editor; every 
from the planning, to setup, to execution was a first for me, so it was 
pretty rough (laughs). </p>

   <p class="interviewer">――How about things you think of in terms of aiming to make a mainstream battle fantasy title? What are they?</p>
   <div class="thumbnail"><img src="MANGA%20Plus%20Interviewing%20editors_bestanden/thumbnail-sakakibara.png"></div>
   <p><b>Sakakibara:</b> 
     For Kaku-sensei himself, he absolutely must make his female 
characters cute! We thought about what works well in a web-based manga, 
and from the very first chapter there are some pretty extreme 
illustrations. It’s resulted in high interest and popularity among our 
readers, but on the other hand one concern is that we don’t have a lot 
of female readers, and it’s hard for new readers to get into. That’s the
 issue of the day for us, and Kaku-sensei and I both would love to see 
more of those female votes, so to speak. </p>

    We first decide what’s happening for a set of 10 chapters - a whole 
volume, in terms of comics. With that as a basis, we then meet week 
after week to keep each other up to speed. We meet in person when 
handing over the drafts. And when it’s really hard for make the time for
 it, we talk by phone.</p>

   <p><b>Sakakibara:</b> 
    No – things to do with illustrations are completely up to 
Kaku-sensei. He draws how he wants to draw, and I really value that. 
I’ve asked him about characters in meetings in the past. All the 
characters that show up in Jigokuraku are ‘main characters’ that 
Kaku-sensei has brought to life. Not just Gabimaru - every character 
that shows up in Jigokuraku. They’ve each got their own details and back
 stories, so much so that I find myself thinking “if only these could be
 put in the manga…” – it’s like that because Kaku-sensei loves each and 
every character. Without that love, we wouldn’t often have these moments
 in our meetings where he’ll drop some information like “actually, this 
is a thing in the story” and I stand there saying “really? I didn’t know
 that…” (laughs). There’s this ‘realness’ that Kaku-sensei is conscious 
of. He said it was brought to his attention as an assistant to Tatsuki 
Fujimoto back before Jigokuraku was serialized, and the idea really blew
 his mind. He used the word ‘realness’ to describe emotions, actions and
 lines the character would play out ‘in the moment’, as if these 
characters are actually existing at that point in time. Kaku-sensei can 
do that kind of thing because all those details and stories are there in
 his head, even if they don’t make it on to the page.</p>

   <p class="interviewer">――Are there any memorable moments from your meetings that you could share with us?</p>
   <div class="thumbnail"><img src="MANGA%20Plus%20Interviewing%20editors_bestanden/thumbnail-sakakibara.png"></div>
   <p><b>Sakakibara:</b> 
    With Kaku-sensei being a former editor, there are times when I don’t
 have to explain everything in fine detail for him to understand. If 
there are ten things I want to tell him, all I’d need to mention seven 
or eight and he infers the rest. He has deep enough knowledge of things 
that if I come to him with something out of left field, or requests for 
things outside of manga, he’s quick to get it. It’s a huge help! 
(laughs) In addition to that, I remember one conversation we had about 
“working on silencing the editor voice inside” – as a manga author, you 
often seek out the fun illogically and put it on the pages. That’s how 
great works are made. But in contrast to that, the editor will try to 
organize things objectively. They point out things that are hard to 
understand. They fix things that contradict. Kaku-sensei himself very 
much has this editor’s way of looking at things, and it comes out even 
when drawing manga. He said he unconsciously hits the brakes, and fun 
for its own sake, things that he wants to do simply because he wants to 
do them, fall by the wayside. </p>

   <p class="interviewer">――You mean the very fact he was a manga editor was actually getting in his way?</p>
   <div class="thumbnail"><img src="MANGA%20Plus%20Interviewing%20editors_bestanden/thumbnail-sakakibara.png"></div>
   <p><b>Sakakibara:</b> 
    I feel like editors have this tendency to make things ‘normal’. But 
once an author breaks that down, big hits get made. I think Kaku-sensei 
probably noticed this while creating manga that was heading towards that
 ‘normal’ direction. </p>

   <p class="interviewer">――What should an editor be to an author?</p>
   <div class="thumbnail"><img src="MANGA%20Plus%20Interviewing%20editors_bestanden/thumbnail-sakakibara.png"></div>
   <p><b>Sakakibara:</b> 
    There probably are as many different ways of interacting with 
authors as there are authors themselves. What they all have in common 
though is that you put your author and their work first. You often think
 about what the author is hoping for and support that, filling in the 
gaps, so to speak. For Kaku-sensei, he always wants an objective 
perspective, and I make sure to thoroughly support him with that.</p>

   <p class="interviewer">――What is your relationship with Jigokuraku?</p>
   <div class="thumbnail"><img src="MANGA%20Plus%20Interviewing%20editors_bestanden/thumbnail-sakakibara.png"></div>
   <p><b>Sakakibara:</b> 
    What I’m about to say is my personal belief as a manga editor, but 
there are plenty of editors out there who know more about manga than I 
do. The same is true for authors that have read more manga than me. When
 I ask myself what my strengths are, what I can say for certain is that 
the things I’ve read and have gotten obsessed with have gotten a lot of 
praise worldwide. Looking at that another way, if I truly find a manga 
to be good, and that manga goes out into the world, you can be assured 
that others will also think that it’s good. I operate with that mindset.
 I think Jigokuraku is good. And as the person responsible for it, I’m 
really going for it in a number of ways: as the person in charge of it 
and as a member of the Jump Plus editorial department, I feel I have to 
make Jigokuraku into a heavy-hitter. I myself am striving hard for that.
 There’s also the face that in Jump Plus, and speaking more broadly, in 
the world of web manga, there is still no web-born title that everyone 
can agree is a mega hit as of yet. I believe that Jigokuraku is the 
title that has the potential to go the distance, into that uncharted 
territory. It’s my duty to go as hard as I can every day in order to 
make that happen. In addition, I want to break 1 million copies of the 
first volume sold! </p>
